# DriverExam
The first fully functional program that I've created, written this year for the second lab in Programming 2. 
We were required to create a program that a teacher could use to grade a Driving Exam; 
the requirements were that the user can enter the student's answers, after which the program would display the final grade. 

My version of the program can read and write new files for each student who takes the exam, 
and can also load text files that contain test answer lists.
